# Guard against shipped plugin changes landing on main without a version bump:
# the plugin updater keys its install cache on .claude-plugin/plugin.json's
# version, so a main tip that changes shipped files but not the version makes
# later updates silently serve the old code.
#
# The check is stateless and self-healing: find the commit that introduced the
# current version, and if any shipped paths changed since it, bump and push a
# commit. A missed or failed run is repaired by the next one. The bump size
# follows Conventional Commits across the uncovered range: a breaking marker
# (`!` after the type, or a BREAKING CHANGE footer) bumps major, `feat` bumps
# minor, anything else bumps patch. A manual bump of any size covers the
# changes that landed with it, so the run becomes a no-op.
#
# Run from the repository root on the main branch with full history.
