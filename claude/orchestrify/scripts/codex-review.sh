# orchestrify stage 4c — run the independent, cross-model Codex reviewer over the
# uncommitted changes in ONE work item's worktree, deterministically.
#
# This wraps the fragile parts of the invocation that the SKILL otherwise guards
# with prose: the worktree cwd, the mandatory `< /dev/null`, the GNU timeout
# bound, bounded retries with exponential backoff (subscription-auth 429s come
# in bursts, so spaced retries succeed where an immediate one would not), and —
# the part the orchestrator cannot eyeball — the guarantee that a non-empty
# review artifact actually exists before the fix agent reads it. An empty or truncated artifact is treated as a failure, never
# as a clean pass.
#
# Usage:
#   codex-review.sh <worktree> <output-file> <prompt-file>
#
#   <worktree>     item worktree to review from (codex exec review has no --cd,
#                  and review mode never edits source, so we just cd into it)
#   <output-file>  where Codex writes its findings (passed to `codex -o`)
#   <prompt-file>  file holding the assembled adversarial review prompt; the
#                  orchestrator owns its content, this script owns the mechanics
#
# Env:
#   CODEX_REVIEW_TIMEOUT   seconds for the per-attempt timeout bound (default 900)
#   CODEX_REVIEW_ATTEMPTS  max attempts, backoff 5s/15s/45s between (default 4)
#
# Output: diagnostics on stderr; one machine-readable line on stdout, last:
#   CODEX_REVIEW: COMPLETED <output-file>     review artifact written, non-empty
#   CODEX_REVIEW: FAILED <reason>             did not complete after all attempts
#
# Exit 0 iff the review completed and the artifact is non-empty; non-zero otherwise.

  # `git status`/`git diff` itself from the worktree cwd and reviews the working-tree
  # changes — tracked edits AND untracked new files — with no staging by us (the
  # commit stage owns staging, by name, later). The trade vs `--uncommitted` is that
  # untracked-file coverage is best-effort rather than guaranteed; the prompt names
  # the item's owned paths to steer Codex onto them.
