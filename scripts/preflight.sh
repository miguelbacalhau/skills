# orca pre-flight — read-only environment validation, run once during
# Step 1 before the brief is confirmed. Config and settings paths are
# resolved from git (the common dir's parent for .orca/, the worktree
# top level for .claude/), so running from a subdirectory can neither
# silently downgrade a pinned reviewer nor produce false timeout FAILs.
#
# Reads one config key — "reviewer" from ./.orca/config — to decide
# whether the codex gate applies; otherwise touches nothing. Prints one
# machine-readable line per gate:
#   <KEY>: PASS
#   <KEY>: FAIL: <terse remediation>
#   <KEY>: SKIPPED: <why it was not checked>   (CODEX only)
# plus informational TRUNK_CANDIDATE, REVIEWER, and CONFIG lines and a
# final RESULT line.
#
# No AGENTS gate and no MCP-registration checks: the subagent definitions
# and the codex MCP server registration ship inside the orca plugin, so a
# session that can run this skill has them by construction. What only the
# live session can check — the codex MCP tool actually resolving — is
# SKILL.md Step 1's job.
#
# Does NOT check bypassPermissions mode — that is not observable from a shell
# and stays a conversational gate in SKILL.md.
#
# Exit 0 iff every gate passes; non-zero if any gate fails. No side effects.

# CLIENT-side setting: the plugin's .mcp.json registers the server, but a
# plugin cannot set the session env that governs MCP tool-call timeouts, so
# it still lives in a settings env block (project or user) that orca:doctor
# writes. Nothing here can check what is LOADED in the current session —
# the live check (does the codex MCP tool resolve?) is SKILL.md Step 1's
# job, in the session itself.
# Project settings can live in the worktree the session runs in or beside
# the bare repo at the root; both are checked, then the user scope.
