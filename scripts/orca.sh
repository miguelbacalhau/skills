# orca CLI — the single entry point for the plugin's deterministic
# verbs. The relay contract is one stable string in workflow JS and
# agent prompts:
#
#   bash "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/orca.sh" <verb> [args...]
#
# The dispatcher is a case statement and nothing more (no
# option-parsing framework, no plugin system for the plugin): it
# sources lib.sh once via its own absolute location, then sources the
# verb file with the remaining arguments in place. Sourcing over
# exec'ing verbs is deliberate — every verb is a short-lived process
# already, so process isolation buys nothing, and lib.sh's fail()
# exiting the whole process is exactly the wanted typed-failure shape.
#
# Runtime envelope: bash 3.2 + git (>= 2.31) + coreutils.
