# orca triage — the read-only discovery spine of orca:feature's and
# orca:debug's Step 0: what is waiting under .orca/, and the byte-exact
# resume handles for anything interrupted. Both skills call the same
# subcommand and read only their own line types; the "is it actually live
# right now" check stays conversational — only the session can inspect its
# own task list and background tasks. No bare-layout requirement: triage
# runs before the preflight.
#
# The `status` subcommand adds the other half of the picture for
# orca:status's dashboard: the runs' git footprint — feature/* branches and
# orca-* worktrees — joined to their run directories by slug.
#
# Usage:
#   triage.sh discover
#   triage.sh status
#
# discover output contract — one machine-readable line per fact,
# TAB-separated:
#
#   RUN:<TAB><run-dir><TAB>interrupted|unlaunched
#       Feature runs: .orca/*/spec.md at depth 1 (feat-briefs/ has none;
#       debug runs keep theirs nested at fix/spec.md) with no sibling
#       report.md. interrupted -> the workflow launched; followed by:
#         RUNID:<TAB><id|absent>         the LAST **Workflow run:** line
#                                        (absent when its value is empty —
#                                        a hand-mangled record)
#         ARGS:<TAB><json|absent>        from that run's own record only —
#                                        the lines following the last run
#                                        line; a record cut short (session
#                                        died between the two appends)
#                                        reports absent, never an older
#                                        launch's values under a newer runId
#         REVIEWER:<TAB><value|absent>   legacy fallback, pre-args records;
#         AGENTS:<TAB><json|absent>      same adjacency rule
#       unlaunched -> spec.md carries no runId line, OR the directory holds
#       brief.md with no spec.md yet (the session died between consuming
#       the brief and writing the spec — the brief would otherwise be lost
#       to all discovery, feat-briefs/ no longer holding it). Not
#       journal-resumable; the run skill decides the recovery.
#   DONE:<TAB><run-dir><TAB>clean|leftovers|unknown
#       Finished feature runs: depth-1 spec.md WITH a sibling report.md.
#       Emitted in directory order (timestamped names -> oldest first);
#       consumed by orca:retry's and orca:followup's run picks. The third
#       field routes recovery: `leftovers` when report.md's "## Blocked"
#       section lists anything other than "None" (-> orca:retry has unmet
#       items to finish), `clean` when it is "None" (-> orca:followup owns
#       what remains), `unknown` when the section cannot be found (a
#       hand-edited or pre-plugin report). Grep-only and fail-open: unknown
#       still gets retry offered — the audit is the real check, this marker
#       is routing sugar.
#   BRIEF:<TAB><path>
#       Queued briefs: .orca/feat-briefs/*.md, top level only (drafts/
#       does not count).
#   CASE:<TAB><slug><TAB>interrupted|ready
#       Open cases: .orca/bug-cases/<slug>/case.md. interrupted -> the LAST
#       **Workflow run:**/**Workflow args:** pair names a run dir with no
#       report.md; followed by the same RUNID:/ARGS: lines. ready -> never
#       launched, or the last run completed and left the case open.
#
#   Exit 0 always — empty output means nothing is waiting. The only typed
#   failures: FAIL:<TAB>NOT_GIT<TAB><detail> and FAIL:<TAB>OLD_GIT<TAB><detail> (git < 2.31), exit 1.
#
# status output contract — TAB-separated, one line per git fact. Only the
# runs' own footprint is emitted — the feature/* branch namespace and
# orca-* worktree directory names; the user's branches and worktrees never
# appear. The last field of each line joins the fact to the newest .orca
# run directory carrying its slug (run dirs, orca-<slug> worktree names,
# and feature/<slug>[-<ID>] branch names all carry the slug by
# construction); no surviving run directory reads `orphan`.
#
#   TRUNK:<TAB><branch>
#       The bare repo HEAD's symbolic-ref — the same source preflight's
#       TRUNK_CANDIDATE reads. Absent when HEAD is detached or unset;
#       integration merged-ness then reports unknown, never a guessed
#       trunk.
#   BRANCH:<TAB>feature/<slug><TAB>merged|unmerged|unknown<TAB>ahead:<n|unknown><TAB><run-dir|orphan>
#       Integration branches — feature/* with no -W<N>-shaped suffix —
#       tested against the trunk. ahead:<n> counts the commits the trunk
#       lacks, so "unmerged by one WIP commit" and "unmerged by the whole
#       feature" read differently.
#   ITEMBR:<TAB>feature/<slug>-<ID><TAB>merged|unmerged|unknown<TAB><run-dir|orphan>
#       Item branches (-W<N>-shaped suffix), tested against their
#       integration branch — or against the trunk when that branch is gone
#       (landed and deleted), unknown when neither target exists. merged
#       means a lossless prune; unmerged corroborates a kept blocked item.
#   WORKTREE:<TAB><path><TAB><branch|detached><TAB><run-dir|orphan>
#       orca-* worktree directories only: orca-<slug>[-W<N>] joins its
#       feature run dir (*-feat-<slug>), orca-bug-<slug>[-H<N>] and
#       orca-fix-<slug> join their debug run dir (*-bug-<slug>).
#
#   Read-only, exit 0 always — empty output (beyond TRUNK:) means git holds
#   no orca footprint. Shares discover's typed failures, FAIL: NOT_GIT / OLD_GIT.
#
# The ARGS payloads are the point: a resume must replay the launch args
# byte-identical (any drift changes agent prompts and re-runs completed
# stages instead of replaying them from the journal), and extracting the
# one-line JSON here keeps it out of model transcription.
