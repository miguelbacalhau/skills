# orca triage — the read-only discovery spine of orca:feature's and
# orca:debug's Step 0: what is waiting under .orca/, and the byte-exact
# resume handles for anything interrupted. Both skills call the same
# subcommand and read only their own line types; the "is it actually live
# right now" check stays conversational — only the session can inspect its
# own task list and background tasks. No bare-layout requirement: triage
# runs before the preflight.
#
# Usage:
#   triage.sh discover
#
# Output contract — one machine-readable line per fact, TAB-separated:
#
#   RUN:<TAB><run-dir><TAB>interrupted|unlaunched
#       Feature runs: .orca/*/spec.md at depth 1 (feat-briefs/ has none;
#       debug runs keep theirs nested at fix/spec.md) with no sibling
#       report.md. interrupted -> the workflow launched; followed by:
#         RUNID:<TAB><id>                the LAST **Workflow run:** line
#         ARGS:<TAB><json|absent>        from that run's own record only —
#                                        the lines following the last run
#                                        line; a record cut short (session
#                                        died between the two appends)
#                                        reports absent, never an older
#                                        launch's values under a newer runId
#         REVIEWER:<TAB><value|absent>   legacy fallback, pre-args records;
#         AGENTS:<TAB><json|absent>      same adjacency rule
#       unlaunched -> spec.md carries no runId line: the run died before
#       its workflow launched (not resumable).
#   BRIEF:<TAB><path>
#       Queued briefs: .orca/feat-briefs/*.md, top level only (drafts/
#       does not count).
#   CASE:<TAB><slug><TAB>interrupted|ready
#       Open cases: .orca/bug-cases/<slug>/case.md. interrupted -> the LAST
#       **Workflow run:**/**Workflow args:** pair names a run dir with no
#       report.md; followed by the same RUNID:/ARGS: lines. ready -> never
#       launched, or the last run completed and left the case open.
#
#   Exit 0 always — empty output means nothing is waiting. The only typed
#   failure: FAIL:<TAB>NOT_GIT<TAB><detail>, exit 1.
#
# The ARGS payloads are the point: a resume must replay the launch args
# byte-identical (any drift changes agent prompts and re-runs completed
# stages instead of replaying them from the journal), and extracting the
# one-line JSON here keeps it out of model transcription.
