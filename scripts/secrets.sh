#
# orca secrets — the sole writer of the placement symlinks that carry
# <repo-root>/.orca/secrets/ into worktrees. `git worktree add` materializes
# tracked files only, and secrets are by definition untracked, so every
# worktree orca creates is born without its `.env`s; the loops and skills
# invoke this script directly after every `worktree add`, and never
# hand-roll the symlinks themselves.
#
# The tree is the mapping — no manifest, no config: a file's path inside
# .orca/secrets/ IS its destination path inside the worktree
# (.orca/secrets/apps/api/.env → <worktree>/apps/api/.env). Each placement
# is one RELATIVE symlink, depth computed per destination, so links survive
# the repo root moving — worktrees and .orca/ move together.
#
# Usage:
#   secrets.sh place <worktree>
#   secrets.sh remove <worktree>
#
# remove is place's inverse, for least-privilege staging: the loops strip
# placement links from a worktree before stages that consume adversarial
# content and need no credentials (the independent review), and re-place
# them for stages that do (implement, fix, integrate, reproduce). Only
# links passing the resolved-target ownership test are touched. Emits one
# UNPLACED:<TAB><relpath> per removed link and a final
# UNPLACED_TOTAL:<TAB><n>; exits 0 even when nothing was removed.
#
# Output contract — one typed TAB-separated line per fact:
#
#   place (idempotent; a re-run over a placed worktree is all OK lines):
#     OK:<TAB>no secrets            no .orca/secrets/ (or nothing in it) — clean no-op
#     LINKED:<TAB><relpath>         new relative symlink created
#     RELINKED:<TAB><relpath>       our symlink was broken or wrong-depth — replaced
#     OK:<TAB><relpath>             already the expected link
#     UNIGNORED:<TAB><relpath>      git would track this path — never placed
#     SKIPPED_EXISTS:<TAB><relpath> a real file (or a foreign symlink) is there — never overwritten
#     SKIPPED_IRREGULAR:<TAB><relpath>  non-regular file inside secrets/ (stray symlink, socket)
#     SKIPPED_GONE:<TAB><relpath>   dangling link whose canonical file is gone — removed
#     SKIPPED_ERROR:<TAB><relpath>  the link could not be written (filesystem error)
#     PLACED:<TAB><n><TAB>SKIPPED:<TAB><m>    summary — n destinations correctly linked, m skipped
#
#   any subcommand:
#     FAIL:<TAB><reason><TAB><detail>    exit 1
#       reasons: BAD_ARGS NOT_GIT OLD_GIT OUTSIDE_ROOT
#
# Ownership is by RESOLVED target, never substring: a symlink is ours to
# manage (repair, replace, or sweep) only when resolving it lands on this
# repository's .orca/secrets tree at the same relative destination. A link
# into another repo's .orca/secrets, a backup.orca/secrets/x path, or any
# other look-alike is state — skipped in the walk, left alone by the sweep.
#
# Per-file problems are typed skips on a zero exit — placement is best
# effort and must never fail the caller's compound command; only misuse
# (bad args, not a worktree) exits 1. The UNIGNORED gate is the safety
# property: a path `git check-ignore` does not report ignored (tracked
# paths included — check-ignore consults the index) is a path a commit
# could pick up, so it never receives a secret.
