# orca review — the deterministic spine of /orca:review: deliverable
# discovery, editor/terminal resolution, probes, and the launch. The
# skill stays the conversational shell (triage, failure translation,
# the parting message); this script owns the plumbing.
#
# Usage:
#   review.sh discover
#   review.sh open <worktree>
#   review.sh probe <nvim|vscode>
#   review.sh wait <window-id>
#   review.sh notes <worktree>
#
# Output contract — one machine-readable line per fact, fields
# TAB-separated (worktree paths may contain spaces):
#
#   discover (read-only):
#     TRUNK:<TAB><trunk>                            informational, emitted once
#     DELIVERABLE:<TAB><branch><TAB><worktree><TAB>ok|missing
#       ok      -> checked out at <worktree> per `git worktree list --porcelain`
#       missing -> branch unmerged but no worktree has it; <worktree> is the
#                  namespace-derived path a re-add would use
#     A DELIVERABLE with a review-notes file carrying open comments gets the
#     notes subcommand's NOTES: line appended right after it (NOTES_VERSION:
#     on a version the script doesn't speak — informational here, exit
#     unchanged). This is the decoupled pick-up: unconsumed comments are
#     discoverable state, like queued briefs.
#     Exit 0 even with zero DELIVERABLE lines — an empty list is an answer,
#     not an error.
#
#   open (read-only except the launch itself):
#     NOTES:<TAB><path>                             where review comments land —
#       <repo-root>/.orca/review-notes/<key>.json, <key> the head branch
#       sanitized per orca.nvim's rule; emitted for every tier and for the
#       PRINT_ONLY paths alike (the path is where comments *will* land whether
#       or not anyone waits on them); omitted when HEAD names no branch
#     PROBE_FAILED:<TAB><nvim|vscode><TAB><detail>  informational — a detected
#       (not pinned) tier failed its probe and the next tier was tried
#     OPEN:<TAB>nvim-tmux<TAB><window-id>           exit 0, launched
#     OPEN:<TAB>vscode<TAB><worktree>               exit 0, launched
#     PRINT_ONLY:<TAB><reason><TAB><detail>         exit 2, nothing launched —
#       + COMMAND:<TAB><exact fallback for the user to run themselves>
#       reasons: EDITOR_NONE TERMINAL_NONE NO_TMUX NO_EDITOR
#                TMUX_LAUNCH_FAILED VSCODE_LAUNCH_FAILED
#
#   probe (read-only, machine-level — needs no git repository, so doctor's
#   machine-only mode can call it):
#     PROBE_OK:<TAB><nvim|vscode>                   exit 0, the tier probes clean
#     PROBE_FAILED:<TAB><nvim|vscode><TAB><detail>  exit 1, with the same detail
#       strings the open subcommand emits
#
#   wait (machine-level, designed to run under a background Bash so the
#   session is re-invoked when nvim exits):
#     CLOSED:<TAB><window-id>                       exit 0, the tmux window is
#       gone — polls list-windows every 5s; exits immediately when the window
#       never existed (late waiter, not an error). Polling over `tmux
#       wait-for` deliberately: the signal-before-listener race loses the
#       wake, and window death also covers a crashed nvim.
#
#   notes (read-only — the validated read of the review-notes file):
#     NOTES_NONE:<TAB><path>                        exit 0, no file — no
#       comments; the plugin deletes the file with the last comment, so no
#       file and no comments mean the same thing
#     NOTES_VERSION:<TAB><found><TAB><spoken>       exit 1 — a version this
#       script doesn't speak; refuse to touch or count anything
#     NOTES:<TAB><path><TAB><open>,<addressed>,<answered>   exit 0, comment
#       counts by status
#     Counting is grep-only by design, like the config reads: the sole writer
#     is vim.json.encode emitting compact well-formed JSON, and inside a JSON
#     string every quote is escaped as \" — so the raw byte sequences
#     "status":"open" etc. can only be the real keys; comment text cannot
#     forge them. The script never parses comment bodies.
#
#   any subcommand:
#     FAIL:<TAB><reason><TAB><detail>               exit 1, nothing launched
#       reasons: NOT_GIT NOT_BARE NO_TRUNK BAD_ARGS NO_SUCH_WORKTREE

#                PINNED_TERMINAL_UNSET
#
# Config comes from <repo-root>/.orca/config.json — the flat top-level
# `editor` (nvim|vscode|none) and `terminal` (tmux|none) keys, each with
# the three-state contract: absent -> detect, pinned -> loud FAIL when its
# dependency is missing, none -> opt out to PRINT_ONLY. Detection probes
# nvim first, then vscode; the terminal key is consulted only when the
# editor resolved to nvim (the vscode launch is a detached GUI). Nothing
# here writes the config — that is orca:config's job.
#
# Extraction is grep-only by design: orca:config is the sole writer and
# emits compact well-formed JSON in which these can only be top-level keys.
