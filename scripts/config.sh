# orca config — the sole reader/writer of <repo-root>/.orca/config.
# The orca:config skill stays the conversational shell (presentation,
# advice, failure translation); this script owns the parse, the
# validation, the merge/removal semantics, and the canonical write.
# preflight.sh and review.sh read the file with grep, justified by the
# guarantee that lives HERE (via lib.sh): this script is the only
# writer, and it only ever writes the canonical shape below.
#
# The file is flat dotted key=value (see lib.sh's config section for
# the grammar); the legacy .orca/config.json is no longer read by
# anything — preflight.sh emits an informational CONFIG: OBSOLETE line
# while one exists, and orca:config offers to delete it.
#
# Usage:
#   config.sh show
#   config.sh validate
#   config.sh set <field>=<value> [...]     # plan.model=sonnet reviewer=claude
#   config.sh clear <field> [...]           # plan.model reviewer
#   config.sh reset [stage]
#
# Output contract — one machine-readable line per fact, fields TAB-separated:
#
#   show (read-only; a file that fails validation FAILs — fix via set/clear/reset):
#     REVIEWER:<TAB><codex|claude><TAB>pinned      or  REVIEWER:<TAB>absent
#     EDITOR:<TAB><nvim|vscode|none|absent>
#     TERMINAL:<TAB><tmux|none|absent>
#     OVERRIDE:<TAB><stage><TAB><model|effort><TAB><value>    one per set field
#     DEFAULT:<TAB><stage><TAB><model><TAB><effort>           from the plugin's
#       agents/<stage>.md frontmatter, stages in vocabulary order. The review
#       stage appears twice, as review-codex AND review-claude — the caller
#       renders the row for the effective reviewer, which this script never
#       resolves: detection is preflight.sh's job (its REVIEWER: line), and
#       the caller composes the two outputs.
#
#   validate (read-only):
#     VALID:<TAB><compact-json>    exit 0 — the canonical launch block: the
#       pinned reviewer plus the agents overrides, exactly what the run
#       skills hold for the Workflow args. editor/terminal are validated but
#       excluded — they are orca:review preferences, not launch args. An
#       absent file is a valid state: VALID:<TAB>{}
#       (The one place JSON survives the format migration: the launch
#       skills pass this object straight into Workflow args, and the
#       workflow scripts validate that shape at launch. Emitting JSON for
#       a closed lowercase-token vocabulary is a printf with no escaping
#       concerns; parsing was the hard part, and parsing is flat-file.)
#
#   set / clear / reset (write): the resulting state as show emits it
#   (DEFAULT lines included), plus
#     WROTE:<TAB><path>       or  DELETED:<TAB><path>
#   set assigns field=value; the value `default` clears that field instead.
#   clear removes bare fields (<stage>.<model|effort> or a top-level key).
#   reset <stage> clears one stage; reset with no argument clears everything
#   — file deletion included, and it works even on an unparseable file (the
#   recovery path: a full reset never needs a parse).
#   Writes are reject-all-or-write-nothing: every bad assignment (and any
#   pre-existing bad value the merge would preserve) gets its own FAIL line,
#   and nothing is written on a nonzero exit.
#
#   any subcommand:
#     FAIL:<TAB><reason><TAB><detail>    exit 1, nothing written
#       reasons: NOT_GIT OLD_GIT BAD_ARGS PARSE_ERROR DUPLICATE_KEY
#                UNKNOWN_KEY UNKNOWN_STAGE UNKNOWN_MODEL UNKNOWN_EFFORT
#                UNKNOWN_REVIEWER UNKNOWN_EDITOR UNKNOWN_TERMINAL
#                WRITE_ERROR
#
# Canonical write shape — the contract the grep-readers in preflight.sh and
# review.sh assume (they stay grep-only BECAUSE this script is the sole
# writer): one key=value per line, fixed order (reviewer, editor, terminal,
# then stages in vocabulary order, model before effort), cleared keys
# removed entirely (never "default"), and a file that would be empty is
# deleted instead.
#
# Works in both layouts: the bare-with-worktrees layout orca:init creates
# (.orca/ sits beside the bare repo, outside every worktree) and a
# conventional checkout — where <repo-root> IS a working tree, so when this
# script writes there it also ensures `.orca/` is listed in
# <git-common-dir>/info/exclude (the per-clone ignore file), keeping a stray
# `git add -A` from committing per-machine preferences.
