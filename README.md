## Install Codex Skills

Install the Codex versions into the user skills directory with symlinks:

```bash
./install-codex-skills.sh
```

By default, this links `codex/*` into `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills`.
Use `--dry-run` to preview, `--target DIR` to install elsewhere, and `--force`
to replace existing targets.

Remove the symlinks with:

```bash
./uninstall-codex-skills.sh
```

## Install Claude Skills

Install the Claude versions into the Claude skills directory with symlinks:

```bash
./install-claude-skills.sh
```

By default, this links `claude/*` into `$HOME/.claude/skills`.
Use `--dry-run` to preview, `--target DIR` to install elsewhere, and `--force`
to replace existing targets.

Remove the symlinks with:

```bash
./uninstall-claude-skills.sh
```
