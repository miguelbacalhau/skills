# orca

A [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) plugin for autonomous, multi-agent development — two verbs on one substrate. Set the repository up once, then **`/orca:feature`** takes a feature from idea to a committed integration branch (an adversarial interview captures intent as a durable brief; a deterministic workflow plans, implements, independently reviews, fixes, commits, merges, and verifies), and **`/orca:debug`** takes a bug from symptom to a verified diagnosis — and, in scope, a committed fix (an interview captures the symptom as a durable case; a deterministic workflow establishes a reproduction, fans out adversarial hypothesis verification, judges a root cause, and lands a fix that must turn the repro green). Either way the user interacts exactly once after the interview (features: twice, by opt-in).

```text
/orca:feature <idea>     # triage → interview/brief → spec → work loop → report
                         # (interactive until one confirmation, autonomous after)
/orca:debug <symptom>    # triage → interview/case → repro gate → hypotheses →
                         # verify → diagnose → fix → repro check → report
/orca:review             # review a deliverable in your editor; your comments round-trip
                         # (addressed on consent, resolutions rendered inline next review)
/orca:retry              # finish a finished run's unmet items in the same run: audit against
                         # git, resolve the blocked decisions with you, relaunch the work loop
/orca:followup           # turn a finished run's optional follow-ups into the next brief
                         # for /orca:feature (new intent, not recovery)
/orca:status             # read-only dashboard: .orca state joined with git ground truth,
                         # grouped by next action, each state naming its skill
/orca:init               # one-time repository layout setup      (interactive, consent per step)
/orca:doctor             # one-time machine tooling setup        (interactive, consent per step)
/orca:config             # optional per-repo reviewer & model/effort tuning
```

The deliverable of a run is a branch on an integration worktree — `feature/<slug>` for features, `fix/<slug>` for fixed bugs — which you review with `/orca:review` and land yourself with `git merge --no-ff <branch>`. The runs never touch your own worktree, and no commit they produce mentions Claude, AI, agents, or orca.

## How it works

Three design choices carry the whole system:

**Double isolation.** Every stage — spec, plan, implement, review, fix, commit, merge, integrate on the feature side; reproduce, hypothesize, verify, diagnose on the debug side — runs in a dedicated subagent with its own context window, and every unit of parallel work (a feature's work item, a debug run's hypothesis) gets its own git worktree off a shared bare repository. Heavy context — codebase exploration, diffs, instrumented runs, test output — lives and dies inside subagents; the main conversation only reads artifact files and the workflow's structured result. Parallel items can never corrupt each other's files: overlap surfaces as an explicit merge conflict, resolved by a merge agent holding both items' plans.

**Independent review.** Claude implements; a separate reviewer attacks the result before anything is committed. The featured default is cross-model: [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) reviews, through an MCP registration the plugin bundles for the global `codex` binary (`codex mcp-server`), driven adversarially over each item's diff by a dedicated courier agent — an independent second opinion from a different model family, one that does not share the implementer's blind spots. The review explicitly attacks the tests, since the same model family wrote the code and the tests. With `reviewer=claude` — the detected default wherever codex isn't installed, or an explicit pin via `/orca:config` — a dedicated Claude review agent performs the same adversarial review itself: it keeps fresh-context independence (a separate agent, only the artifacts and the diff), but it is same-model, so it may share the implementer's blind spots. That trade-off is stated wherever the choice is made; cross-model stays the stronger design.

**A deterministic work loop.** The long autonomous middle of a run is one bundled script executed through Claude Code's Workflow tool, not conversational orchestration. Scheduling, retry bounds, review throttling, merge serialization, and the commit-attribution check are code, so the guarantees are structural rather than model discipline that decays over a long context. Judgment calls (plan reconciliation, escalation, review verdicts) stay in agents, but as schema'd calls whose reasons land in the run's artifacts. Every agent call is journaled, so an interrupted run resumes where it stopped. One honest caveat: the workflow sandbox has no shell, so even "deterministic" git plumbing runs through a small model relay — exit-status markers and marker-delimited output make mis-relay detectable-and-retryable rather than impossible, a probabilistic guarantee by design.

State lives in files, never in conversation memory: the brief, the spec with its work breakdown and decision log, one plan per item, the raw review findings per round, and a final report — all under a per-run directory in `.orca/`.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | A harness with the **Workflow tool** (the work loop runs through it). `/orca:feature` checks and refuses without it. |
| Codex CLI | Required only **when the reviewer is codex** (the default wherever it is installed): the **global `codex` binary on PATH**, version **≥ 0.142.5**, authenticated via `codex login`. **Never install codex via npm** — use `brew install codex` or the official release binaries. With `reviewer=claude`, the codex rows don't apply. |
| Repository layout | Bare-repo-with-worktrees (`.bare/` + peer worktrees). `/orca:init` sets this up, including converting an existing conventional checkout in place. |
| git | ≥ 2.31 (`rev-parse --path-format` — every orca script's repository resolution; older gits get a typed `OLD_GIT` failure naming the upgrade, never a misdiagnosis); ≥ 2.42 for `worktree add --orphan` when `/orca:init` creates a brand-new repository. |
| `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` | Codex-only, like the Codex CLI row: set to `1200000` (~20 min) in a Claude Code settings `env` block, so Codex reviews are not killed at the default MCP tool timeout. A plugin cannot ship session env, so `/orca:doctor` writes it for you. |
| Permission mode | Runs need `bypassPermissions` for the session — see [Permissions and autonomy](#permissions-and-autonomy). |

Everything else — the seventeen stage agents and the codex MCP server registration — ships inside the plugin itself; there is nothing to install per repository beyond the layout.

## Installation

This repository hosts its own plugin marketplace (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), so installing is two commands inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add miguelbacalhau/orca
/plugin install orca@orca
```

The install persists across sessions. Updates are manual by default for third-party marketplaces — pull new versions with `/plugin marketplace update orca`, or toggle auto-update in the `/plugin` → Marketplaces UI. Removal is symmetric: `/plugin marketplace remove orca` uninstalls the marketplace and the plugin in one step.

Teams can make the install declarative instead: commit this to the project's `.claude/settings.json`, and Claude Code prompts each teammate to install the marketplace and pre-enables the plugin when they trust the workspace:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "orca": { "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "miguelbacalhau/orca" } }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "orca@orca": true }
}
```

For local development on the plugin itself, load a checkout directly for a single session:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/this/repo
```

MCP servers load at session start, so after installing or enabling the plugin, **start a fresh session** before running — when the reviewer is codex, `/orca:feature` verifies live that the codex MCP tool resolves and stops if it does not.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1a. One-time per repo: the bare-repo-with-worktrees layout. Interactive,
#     consent per step. Converting an existing checkout preserves untracked
#     files (.env, caches) but changes every path — see /orca:init.
/orca:init

# 1b. One-time per machine, only if the pre-flight flags it: Codex CLI
#     install/auth guidance and the MCP timeout settings write. Skippable
#     outright if you'll run with the Claude reviewer.
/orca:doctor

# 2. The feature. An interview captures intent as a brief file — outcome,
#    features, non-goals, constraints, doubt rule, as many rounds as the
#    idea needs — then, after ONE confirmation, the run drives autonomously
#    to a final report and a feature/<slug> branch. Decline the run prompt
#    to leave the brief queued for a later /orca:feature instead.
/orca:feature add rate limiting to the public API

# 2b. Or the bug. An interview captures the symptom as a durable case —
#     reading the stack traces and logs you point at — then the run
#     reproduces, hypothesizes, verifies, diagnoses, and (by default)
#     lands a fix with a regression test on a fix/<slug> branch.
/orca:debug the export endpoint returns 500 on files over 2MB

# 3. Walk the deliverable's diff in your own editor (nvim, via a tmux
#    window in your session), then land it from your own worktree.
/orca:review
git merge --no-ff feature/<slug>     # or fix/<slug>

# 4. If the report left blocked items: resolve their recorded decisions
#    and finish them inside the same run, on the same branch.
/orca:retry

# 5. If it left optional follow-ups you want: select them into the next
#    run's brief.
/orca:followup
```

Briefs can be queued ahead of time — everything at the top level of `.orca/feat-briefs/` is ready and unconsumed; a later `/orca:feature` finds them, offers to run one, and a run consumes exactly one.

## Commands

### `/orca:feature <idea>`

The one feature verb — a dispatcher over `.orca` state. Triage looks at what is on disk and offers the first match, never forcing it:

1. **An interrupted run** — a run directory whose `spec.md` records a workflow runId with no `report.md` beside it. Offers to resume from the journal; completed work replays instantly, only in-flight and remaining work runs live.
2. **A queued brief** — anything at the top level of `.orca/feat-briefs/`. Offers to run one, or to interview a new idea instead.
3. **Nothing waiting** — interviews the idea into a brief, then asks once: run it now, or leave it queued?

**The interview** sharpens a rough idea into a durable brief at `.orca/feat-briefs/<timestamp>-<slug>.md`. Before asking anything substantive it researches the subsystems the idea touches through the dedicated `orca:research` agent (the report stays behind the scenes; the main context never explores deeply), then interviews from that picture — opening with a reflection of the idea against the system as it exists, so tensions between the two surface in conversation, where changing course is cheap. The brief is the *entire* intent the run acts on — the run asks nothing beyond one confirmation — so the interview is deliberately adversarial about scope: it pushes back, hunts for unstated non-goals, and makes you resolve ambiguities now rather than leaving them for an autonomous run to guess at. Direction decisions it settles land in the brief with their rationale and bind the spec like constraints; the decomposition itself still belongs to the spec stage.

A brief records: **outcome**, **features**, **non-goals**, **inputs & outputs**, **constraints**, plus two run-controlling choices:

- **Doubt rule** — when the run hits an ambiguity, does it prefer the smaller interpretation and cut scope (`prefer-smaller-scope`, the default) or the more complete one (`prefer-complete`)?
- **Breakdown checkpoint** — review the spec and work breakdown once before any code (`review-once`), or run straight through (`straight-through`, the default)?

The brief is *what and why*, never *how*: no work breakdown, no interfaces, no file ownership — those come from the run's spec stage, grounded in real codebase exploration. Location is status: top-level briefs are ready; park unfinished ones in `.orca/feat-briefs/drafts/`. One brief is one run's scope — two independent efforts get two briefs, and declining the run prompt leaves a brief queued for any later `/orca:feature`.

**The run.** See [Anatomy of a run](#anatomy-of-a-run) for the full lifecycle. Interaction surface, in total:

1. **One confirmation** of the restated brief (plus trunk-branch confirmation) — this authorizes everything that follows. It runs in full even when the brief was written seconds earlier in the same session: the file, not the conversation, is the authorized intent.
2. **One optional checkpoint** — only if the brief opted in: review the spec and work breakdown before any code.

After that, nothing asks you anything. Ambiguities resolve against the spec and the doubt rule; what cannot be resolved that way becomes a `blocked` item in the final report, with the options you must choose between recorded. Mid-run, live per-item status shows on the session task list; the outcome lands in `report.md`.

### `/orca:debug <symptom>`

The debug verb — a dispatcher over `.orca/bug-cases/`, where an open **case** is the durable unit the way a brief is for features (location is status: a case stays there until a run closes it). Triage offers the first match, never forcing it:

1. **An interrupted run** — found through its open case, whose `case.md` records the workflow runId and launch args. Offers to resume from the journal.
2. **An open case** — never launched, or left open by a run that ended `not-fixed`, `undiagnosed`, or `no-repro`. Offers to run it with its **ledger** loaded: refuted hypotheses are never re-proposed, inconclusive ones are picked up first, failed-fix diffs are evidence — a re-run starts smarter, not over.
3. **Nothing waiting** — interviews the symptom into a case, then asks once: run it now, or leave it open?

**The interview** differs from the feature one in a single deliberate way: it *reads the evidence you point at* — stack traces, failing CI logs, error output — because the symptom lives in artifacts, not intent, copying them into the case's `evidence/` directory. It captures the symptom verbatim, expected behavior, reproduction steps (or "none known"), last known good (which unlocks automated `git bisect`), environment, what you've already ruled out, and the **scope rule**: `diagnose-and-fix` (the default — the run lands a fix) or `diagnose-only` (the run ends after the judge with a root-cause report).

**The run** (see [Anatomy of a debug run](#anatomy-of-a-debug-run)) interacts exactly once — one confirmation of the restated case and scope. Two hard rules shape it: the **repro gate** (no deterministic reproduction → the run records the attempt in the ledger and stops loudly; there is no evidence-only fallback) and **three-valued verdicts** (`confirmed` requires observed evidence; `inconclusive` is honest and seeds the next run — no manufactured confidence). On `fixed`, the deliverable is a `fix/<slug>` branch carrying the fix plus a regression test derived from the repro.

### `/orca:review [branch]`

The human half of review — the runs' adversarial review stage is automated and lives inside them; this opens the finished deliverable in *your* editor before you land it. It discovers unmerged `feature/<slug>` / `fix/<slug>` deliverable branches (one → opens it; several → asks; a gone integration worktree → offers to add it back) and opens the deliverable's integration worktree in your editor, running an orca review session — file list, native side-by-side merge-base diffs, your LSP and colors. Two editors are supported:

- **nvim** — a **new tmux window in your current session** running [orca.nvim](https://github.com/miguelbacalhau/orca.nvim)'s `:OrcaReview`. Quit nvim (`:qa`) and the window closes, dropping you back where you invoked it, ready to `git merge --no-ff`. tmux is the mechanism, not a convenience — the harness has no TTY to run an interactive editor in, so a new window in the session `$TMUX` points at is the one way a skill puts a live editor in front of you.
- **vscode** — [orca.vscode](https://github.com/miguelbacalhau/orca.vscode)'s review session, opened via `code --open-url` and the extension's URI handler, which routes it to a window on the worktree (opening one if needed). A detached GUI launch — no tmux involved; close the review window when done.

Without tmux (on the nvim path), or without either companion installed (`/orca:doctor` prescribes both), it prints the exact command to run instead (`cd <worktree> && nvim "+OrcaReview"`, `cd <worktree> && code .` plus the palette command, or a `git difftool` fallback) and stops.

**Review comments round-trip.** Comments you leave in the review with `:OrcaComment` persist to `.orca/review-notes/<key>.json` (`<key>` is the deliverable branch, sanitized — orca.nvim's rule). On the nvim path the skill leaves a background waiter on the tmux window: quit nvim and it wakes, reads the file, and lays out every open comment alongside what it intends to do about it — fix (with a one-line approach), answer, decline with reasoning, or defer as too big for review — then **asks** before doing anything (window death means "nvim closed," not "review finished"; you can address now, resume the review with comments intact, or leave them for later). Consent is to that stated plan, not a blank check: correct a misread interpretation right there, before any code changes. On consent, a dedicated agent converts each open comment into a fix or an answer in the integration worktree — change requests get fixed with tests and committed under the same no-attribution rules as every run commit; questions get answered from the code — and writes `status`/`resolution` back into the same file, where the next `:OrcaReview` renders them inline under their anchors. Editing a resolution's comment there re-opens it for the next round; that loop is the convergence mechanism, so there is deliberately no machine re-review after addressing. The file is the source of truth and the window-exit only the wake signal: comments left from the vscode tier, a print-only session, or a review whose session died are picked up by the next `/orca:review`, which surfaces "N unaddressed comments" in triage. The workflow is one-writer-at-a-time by design, and both sides fail loud on a notes schema version they don't speak (`/orca:doctor`'s nvim check diagnoses the skew).

Two config keys govern it, set via `/orca:config`: `editor` (`nvim`|`vscode`|`none`) and `terminal` (`tmux`|`none`, nvim path only), with the same semantics as `reviewer` — absent detects (nvim first, then vscode), a pin fails loudly instead of silently falling back, `none` opts out to the printed command.

### `/orca:retry [run]`

Finishes a finished run's unmet work items **inside the same run** — no new run directory, no new spec, no brief. Recovery never creates a run; only new intent does. It picks a finished feature run with leftovers (newest by default, or the one the argument names), audits it through the same read-only agent `/orca:followup` uses — reconciling the report's claims against the spec's work breakdown and git ground truth — then resolves every blocked item's recorded decision with you. That interview is the entry fee, on principle: the run's escalation agents already spent its bounded machine retries deciding each block could not be resolved within the spec, so a retry without new human input would reproduce it. You can also resurrect items the run cut autonomously (a machine-made scope reduction you never directly approved — overruling it restores scope the original brief contained), and a resolution may authorize the retried item to amend code an earlier item already merged.

Your resolutions are appended to the run's own `spec.md` as binding Decisions bullets; the superseded plans, review findings, and report are archived in place (`plans/<ID>.round<N>.md`, `reviews/prev<N>/`, `report.round<N>.md`) so the failure evidence survives the next round; and the work loop relaunches over only the unmet items, on the same integration branch — each item carrying a retry note that points at its recorded failure evidence, and each surviving item branch (salvaged WIP commit included) resumed rather than restarted. The rewritten report keeps the whole-run picture, with a Prior rounds section naming the archived reports. An *interrupted* run (no report yet) is redirected to `/orca:feature`'s resume; a `clean` run has nothing to retry — its follow-ups are `/orca:followup`'s.

### `/orca:followup [run]`

Turns a finished run's *optional follow-ups* — deferred findings, known gaps, improvements the reviews flagged but did not block on — into the next run's brief. New intent, not recovery: unfinished items and escalated decisions are `/orca:retry`'s job, and an interrupted run is redirected to `/orca:feature`'s resume. It picks a finished feature run (newest by default, or the one the argument names), then audits it through a dedicated read-only agent that reconciles the report's claims against the spec's work breakdown and git ground truth: which items verifiably merged (the integration branch's first-parent log, not the Shipped table), and whether the deliverable branch still exists or was already landed — which decides what the new brief builds on. Discrepancies are named to you plainly.

The discussion is a selection, not an obligation: which follow-ups ride along; unselected ones stay deferred in the old report, losing nothing. The product is a standard brief queued in `.orca/feat-briefs/` — building on the existing integration branch or the trunk per the audit's landed-ness check, with the prior spec's Interfaces and Decisions log as binding inputs — and `/orca:feature` discovers, restates, and runs it like any other brief; this skill never launches a run itself. A run with unmet items is pointed at `/orca:retry` first — a follow-up brief never adopts unmet work or resolves escalated decisions — and a run whose follow-up brief already exists is surfaced rather than duplicated.

### `/orca:init [path or clone URL]`

One-time, consent-per-step setup that makes a repository pass `/orca:feature`'s pre-flight. Handles three cases:

- **New repository** — bare-init plus a default-branch worktree.
- **Clone a URL** — bare clone, fetch refspec fix (bare clones silently fetch nothing without it), default-branch worktree.
- **Convert an existing checkout** — restructures in place: `.git` becomes `.bare`, tracked files move into a `<branch>/` worktree, and **untracked files (including ignored ones — `.env`s, caches) are carried over** via a manifest before anything is deleted. Every path changes, so editors and terminals need re-pointing; the conversion is layout-only (no history, refs, or remotes touched) and reversible until the final cleanup step, which is confirmed separately.

Preconditions for conversion — it stops rather than improvising: a clean tree, no existing linked worktrees, no submodules.

Layout only: machine-gate failures the pre-flight reports (Codex, the MCP timeout) are routed to `/orca:doctor`, not fixed here.

### `/orca:doctor`

Interactive, consent-per-step machine and session tooling — the per-machine counterpart to `/orca:init`'s per-repo layout. It diagnoses with the same read-only pre-flight (or probes codex directly when run outside a repository), reports every gate plus the resolved reviewer in plain language, and fixes only what was flagged:

- **Codex missing or stale** — points you at the official non-npm install (`brew install codex` or the release binaries; never npm). Installing is your action.
- **Not authenticated** — suggests `codex login` and verifies with `codex login status`. Also yours.
- **`MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` unset** — writes it into a settings `env` block (project or user level, your choice), merged, with the session-restart caveat.

It is reviewer-aware: with a detected claude reviewer (codex not installed) there is nothing to fix — it says runs will use the Claude reviewer, explains that installing codex enables the stronger cross-model review, and offers to pin either choice via `/orca:config`. With claude pinned and codex present, it notes the codex gates were skipped by choice. A codex gate failing while the reviewer is codex is always a failure to fix — never a silent switch to the other reviewer.

Optionally — offered, never defaulted — it can write `bypassPermissions` as the default mode for a repo where runs are always unattended, and check for the editor companions `/orca:review` opens: when Neovim is on PATH, the [orca.nvim](https://github.com/miguelbacalhau/orca.nvim) install (prescribed for your plugin manager); when `code` is on PATH, the [orca.vscode](https://github.com/miguelbacalhau/orca.vscode) extension (prescribed as `code --install-extension` against the release VSIX). Both walk a deliverable branch's merge-base diff in your own editor before you `git merge --no-ff` it. Layout failures route the other way: `BARE_REPO: FAIL` goes to `/orca:init`.

### `/orca:config [assignments | reset]`

Optional per-repository overrides, written to `.orca/config` and applied by the **next** run launch (a run in flight, or a resume of one, keeps its launch-time config): which independent reviewer the work loop uses (top-level `reviewer` key), and which Claude model and reasoning effort each stage agent runs with (`agents` block).

```bash
/orca:config                                # show the reviewer + effective table
/orca:config reviewer=claude                # pin the Claude reviewer
/orca:config reviewer=default               # unpin — back to detection
/orca:config plan.model=sonnet review.effort=high
/orca:config plan.model=default             # clear one field
/orca:config reset plan                     # clear one stage
/orca:config reset                          # clear everything (reviewer included)
```

`reviewer` is `codex` or `claude`; when the key is **absent**, each run launch detects — codex binary on PATH at the minimum version → codex, else claude — and a written key pins the choice (pinning `codex` turns a future broken codex into a loud pre-flight `FAIL` instead of a silent claude run). On `reviewer=claude` the skill states the independence trade-off; on `reviewer=codex` it checks that the codex machine gates pass and points at `/orca:doctor` if they don't.

Valid stage values — models `haiku` | `sonnet` | `opus` | `fable`, efforts `low` | `medium` | `high` | `xhigh` | `max`. One caveat: what configuring `review` means depends on the reviewer — with codex it changes the cost of the *courier* that drives Codex, never Codex's review quality; with claude it tunes the actual reviewer (default opus/high). Note that `fable` only works on plans whose harness offers it — and it is the default for `spec` and `plan`, so on a plan without fable access pin them back with `/orca:config spec.model=opus plan.model=opus`. Overrides survive plugin updates; the plugin's own agent definitions are never edited.

```

**Pre-flight** (`scripts/orca.sh preflight`, read-only, also run early during the interview) prints one machine-readable line per gate: `BARE_REPO`, a `REVIEWER: codex|claude (pinned|detected)` line resolving which reviewer the run uses, `CODEX` (binary ≥ 0.142.5, authenticated, `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` set — checked only when the resolved reviewer is codex, `SKIPPED` otherwise), an informational `TRUNK_CANDIDATE`, and a final `RESULT` mirrored by the exit code. On any `FAIL` the run does not start; remediation goes through `/orca:init` for the layout gate and `/orca:doctor` for the machine gates.

**Spec** is written once, by a dedicated read-only agent, from the confirmed brief. Its two load-bearing sections: **Interfaces Between Work Items** — the contracts (type shapes, signatures, file ownership, naming) that let items build in parallel without inventing incompatible seams — and the **Work Breakdown**, which becomes the workflow's item list verbatim, each item carrying a one-line acceptance criterion checkable from the integration worktree. If the requested scope cannot be split cleanly against the codebase, the run surfaces that and stops rather than launching against a spec known to be wrong.

**The work loop** is completion-driven: an item launches the moment its dependencies merge and advances the moment its previous stage finishes. The only synchronization points are deliberate — a per-wave plan-reconciliation barrier (an opus agent checks the wave's plans against the spec Interfaces before anything builds) and the serialized merge queue. Bounded loops keep it from thrashing: max 2 fix rounds gated on Critical/High review findings; a deterministic commit-attribution check against the actual `git log` (two attempts, then a forced rewrite); one amendment round per reconciliation failure; at most one escalation-backed replan-and-rebuild per item. Codex reviews — and only codex reviews, which contend for one Codex auth — are throttled to 2 concurrent slots while everything else parallelizes freely; claude reviews ride the workflow's normal concurrency cap.

**Escalation** applies one rule: **amend and continue** when a fix preserves the brief's outcome, features, and non-goals (the change touches only *how*) — recorded in the spec's `## Decisions` log with the doubt rule cited; **block and route around** when every fix would change *what* was agreed. A blocked item keeps its branch — whatever was in its worktree is salvaged into a WIP commit and the worktree removed — for a `/orca:retry` round, and never stalls unaffected work. Under `prefer-smaller-scope`, cleanly cutting a feature counts as an amendment.

**Integration verification** runs after the loop drains: a dedicated agent builds, tests, and exercises each spec feature end to end in the integration worktree, judging against the spec's Outcome and Features — looking specifically at the seams where items compose. Small integration bugs are fixed, review-checked, and committed; larger mismatches are reported as gaps.

**The report** (`report.md`) is the durable record: shipped items with commit hashes, deviations mirroring the spec's Decisions log, blocked items with the decision each waits on, per-feature integration results, follow-ups sourced from the plans' Deviations sections, knowledge the context agent flagged for human promotion, and the landing command.

## Anatomy of a debug run

Debugging is a different shape of work — unknown outcome, hypothesis fan-out instead of work-item fan-out, convergence by judgment instead of merge — so it gets its own artifacts and workflow (`scripts/debug-loop.workflow.js`), on the same substrate: worktree isolation, journaled resume, and the same stage machinery for the fix.

The durable state is the **case** at `.orca/bug-cases/<slug>/`: `case.md` (the symptom verbatim, expected behavior, repro steps, last known good, environment, evidence pointers, what's ruled out, and the scope rule), `repro.sh` once established, `evidence/`, and the append-only **`ledger.md`** — every hypothesis ever tested with its verdict and every fix attempt, across runs. The ledger is what makes run N+1 converge instead of re-run.

**`repro.sh` is the run's currency**, under the `git bisect run` exit contract: exit 0 = bug absent, 1–127 = bug present, 125 = cannot test. Verify agents use it as their oracle (and bisect with it automatically when the case records a last known good), and the final fix check is simply running it — a zero-judgment checker agent executes it and the workflow branches on the exit code, never on a model's self-report.

   ├─ 2. Debug loop (Workflow)  deterministic script:
   │       repro gate (hard) ──► hypothesize (1–8 ranked, ledger-aware)
   │       ──► verify ∥ (adversarial, one throwaway worktree each)
   │       ──► diagnose (judge) ──► [diagnose-only: stop here]
   │       ──► fix: nested work loop over a synthesized one-item contract
   │       ──► repro check ──► [red? one retry: revert → regenerate
   │                            → verify → diagnose → fix]
   │       ──► [fixed: the context agent folds the fix into the project context]
   └─ 3. Report                 report.md; ledger appended; case closed
                                (fixed/diagnosed) or left open, smarter
```

**The fix tail reuses the feature machinery instead of reimplementing it**: the diagnose agent writes a synthesized spec (root cause, regression-test-from-repro requirement, minimal-diff constraint) to the run's `fix/spec.md`, and the debug workflow nests a call to `work-loop.workflow.js` over that one item — plan, implement, independent review (codex or claude, exactly as configured), fix, commit with the attribution check, merge, integrate. The deliverable branch is `fix/<slug>`, mirroring `feature/<slug>`. A committed fix that leaves the repro red gets exactly one internal retry — the failed attempt is reverted on the branch tip (its diff stays in history as ledger evidence), hypotheses regenerate once with refuted ones excluded — and then the run ends `not-fixed` (or `undiagnosed`, when the retry's hypotheses all die), case open.

A run that ends `no-repro`, `undiagnosed`, or `not-fixed` is a loud, honest stop, not a failure to hide: the ledger records what was tried, and re-invoking `/orca:debug` finds the open case and starts from it.

## Repository layout

What a repository looks like mid-run (`/orca:init` creates the top three entries; the runs create the rest and clean up their transient worktrees):

```

Two naming namespaces, deliberately different: `orca-*` **directory** names are local scratch — the cleanup and discovery story via `git worktree list` — and never enter git; the **branch** names that land in history and on GitHub (`feature/<slug>[-<ID>]`, `fix/<slug>[-<ID>]`) are neutral and carry no orca trace, while throwaway `bug/<slug>*` branches never merge at all. `.orca/` sits outside every worktree, so its contents cannot be committed by accident. Inside `.orca/`, every artifact is verb-prefixed — `feat-briefs/` and `feat-` run directories for the feature verb, `bug-cases/` and `bug-` run directories for the debug verb, `review-notes/` for the review verb — so a bare `ls .orca/` reads unambiguously. `review-notes/` and `secrets/` are the two directories holding user-authored input rather than a cache, but like everything else in `.orca/` they are machine-local scratch and never enter git — and `secrets/` is the one thing in `.orca/` that is not safe to delete (see below).

### Worktree secrets

`git worktree add` materializes tracked files only, and secrets are by definition untracked — so a fresh worktree starts without the `.env`s and local credential files that builds, tests, and repro scripts need. The fix is one folder convention and nothing else: drop a file into `<repo-root>/.orca/secrets/`, and every worktree a run creates from then on has it, linked in right after the `worktree add`.

There is no manifest and no config — **the tree is the mapping**. A secret's path inside `secrets/` is its destination path inside each worktree:

```text
.orca/secrets/.env               →  <worktree>/.env
.orca/secrets/apps/api/.env      →  <worktree>/apps/api/.env
.orca/secrets/config/local.json  →  <worktree>/config/local.json
```

Each file is placed as a **relative symlink**, so every worktree reads the one canonical copy: rotate a token in `.orca/secrets/.env` and every worktree — including a blocked item's, resumed days later — sees the new value immediately, and removing a worktree deletes only links, never a secret. `.orca/` sits outside every worktree (in the bare layout the repo root is not a git working directory at all), so the canonical files are structurally uncommittable — a stronger property than any gitignore rule. As a second gate on the linked side, a destination git would track is skipped loudly (`UNIGNORED:` in the run's logs) and never placed — keep the mirrored paths in `.gitignore`, as untracked secrets already should be. An existing real file at a destination is never overwritten.

Populating the tree is yours to do, by hand — one `mv` per secret: on a fresh clone, drop files in as you obtain them; on a repo `/orca:init` converted, move the `.env`s the conversion preserved in your worktree (`mkdir -p .orca/secrets/apps/api && mv main/apps/api/.env .orca/secrets/apps/api/.env`). Runs place into every worktree **they** create and never write into yours — link your own worktree to the canonical files yourself, by hand (`ln -s ../.orca/secrets/.env main/.env`) or with the same script the runs use, safe on any worktree:

```bash
bash <plugin-root>/scripts/orca.sh secrets place <repo-root>/main
```

Two carve-outs to the usual `.orca/` story. Unlike `map.md` and `decisions.md`, **`secrets/` is not a rebuildable cache — deleting it is data loss**; it is exactly the thing to leave out of any `.orca/` cleanup. And placed secrets are readable by the stage agents whose work needs them — so keep **development** credentials here, never production ones.

Placement is least-privilege by stage: links go in where the work actually needs credentials (implement, fix, integrate, reproduce — builds, tests, repro scripts) and are stripped (`orca.sh secrets remove`, the resolved-target ownership test) before every independent review, the stage that consumes the run's most adversarial content and needs none. With the codex reviewer that separation also keeps secret values away from a different model provider. The recommendation compounds: keep the tree down to what runs actually need — every extra credential in `.orca/secrets/` widens the blast radius of any one compromised stage.

## Project context

Runs used to start blind: every spec, plan, and hypothesize agent re-explored the repository from scratch, and nothing a run learned or decided survived it. Two machine-local files at the top of `.orca/` fix that — consumed at run start, maintained at run end, and **never committed**:

- **`map.md`** — a codebase map at architecture altitude only: module boundaries, entry points, build/test commands, conventions, known gotchas. Hard-capped at ~200 lines (the maintainer prunes, not only appends), headed by a commit stamp `**As of:** <short-sha>`.
- **`decisions.md`** — the decision log: one `chose X over Y: <reason>` entry per load-bearing decision, with date, run id, and the commit that carries it. Append-mostly; a reversal is a new entry pointing at the old one.

The design rule that makes per-machine copies safe is **derivability**: both files are caches over a source of truth git already shares. The map is a cache over the code — any copy self-heals via `git diff <stamp>..HEAD`. The decision log is a cache over commit-message history: the runs write their load-bearing decisions into commit and merge-commit bodies in neutral prose (item-scoped rationale in item commits, run-scoped in merge commits — never both), so a teammate's orca reconstructs the log by catching up with a full `git log <stamp>..HEAD` — full, not `--first-parent`, because the no-ff topology puts item commits on each merge's second parent, and a first-parent walk would see only the run-scoped half. `--first-parent` remains the *human's* run-level view of an orca-built branch: the merge topology is load-bearing, not cosmetic. Locally-written entries keep interview/spec fidelity; reconstructed ones carry commit-message fidelity — both are enough for cross-run consistency.

The lifecycle: `/orca:init` optionally seeds `map.md` with one deep exploration sweep (the only full-project sweep the design performs; a first run with no map seeds lazily instead). Each run start compares the stamps to the trunk tip — equal means skip, stale means one cheap catch-up agent. Consuming agents (spec, plan, hypothesize, diagnose, the interviews) receive both files as **hints, not ground truth** — "where to look first; verify anything you build on" — because a stale map trusted blindly is worse than no map. At run end a dedicated `context` agent folds the run's artifacts into both files: it distills what the run already learned, never re-explores, deletes what the diff invalidated, and advances the stamps. Rule-shaped knowledge ("never install X via npm") is never absorbed into the files — it surfaces in the run report under **Knowledge worth promoting**, for the human to commit into CLAUDE.md or real documentation under their own name. Orca never writes CLAUDE.md.

Delete both files any time; runs rebuild them. Nothing about this touches the repository's committed content — the commit messages the log rides on read as a careful human's history.

## Stage agents

Seventeen agents ship in the plugin (`agents/<stage>.md`, loaded as `orca:<stage>`). Each runs with its own context window and only the per-item values it needs; context passes between stages through artifact files, never relayed summaries.

The first nine serve feature runs — and, `spec` excepted (the diagnose agent writes the fix tail's contract, so no spec agent ever runs there), the fix tail of a diagnose-and-fix debug run:

| Stage | Role | Default model | Default effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spec` | Explores the codebase; writes the spec and work breakdown (once, at the start) | fable | high |
| `plan` | Read-only planner for one item; writes a plan a cheaper implementer can follow | fable | high |
| `implement` | Builds one item in its worktree, checking off and amending its plan | sonnet | high |
| `review-codex` | Courier that drives the Codex review via MCP and files the findings verbatim | sonnet | medium |
| `review-claude` | Performs the independent review itself — same adversarial contract and artifact schema as the Codex path | opus | high |
| `fix` | Applies review findings; escalates findings rooted in the plan, spec, or other items | opus | high |
| `commit` | One Conventional Commit per item, staged by name, no attribution | haiku | low |
| `merge` | Serialized merge into the integration branch; resolves conflicts with both plans in hand; verifies the merged result | opus | high |
| `integrate` | Verifies the assembled feature end to end against the spec | opus | high |

The last four serve debug runs:

| Stage | Role | Default model | Default effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reproduce` | Turns the case into a deterministic `repro.sh` under the bisect exit contract, plus captured evidence | sonnet | high |
| `hypothesize` | Read-only exploration of codebase + case + ledger; writes 1–8 ranked, falsifiable root-cause candidates (aims for 3+, never pads) | opus | xhigh |
| `verify` | Attacks one hypothesis in its own throwaway worktree — instrument, bisect, refute; verdicts need evidence | sonnet | high |
| `diagnose` | The judge: merges verdicts into a root-cause diagnosis and, in scope, the synthesized fix contract | opus | high |

And one serves both verbs, at the tail of a run that landed work:

| Stage | Role | Default model | Default effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `context` | Folds the run's artifacts into the machine-local project context (map + decision log); distills, never re-explores | haiku | low |

And one serves `/orca:review`'s comment round trip, spawned conversationally by the skill rather than by a workflow:

| Stage | Role | Default model | Default effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `address` | Converts the user's open review comments into fixes and answers in the integration worktree; writes resolutions back into the notes file | opus | high |

And one serves the feature interview's research step, spawned conversationally before any run exists:

| Stage | Role | Default model | Default effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `research` | Read-only analytical exploration of the subsystems a rough idea touches; reports current behavior, touched decisions, tensions, and unknowns to the interviewer | opus | high |

And one serves `/orca:retry` and `/orca:followup`, spawned conversationally over a finished run:

| Stage | Role | Default model | Default effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `audit` | Read-only reconciliation of a finished run — report claims vs. work breakdown vs. git ground truth; extracts unfinished items, escalated decisions, and reusable artifacts | opus | high |

A run uses exactly one of `review-codex` / `review-claude`, chosen by the resolved reviewer at launch. The `/orca:config` stage key for both is `review` — the overrides apply to whichever reviewer agent is active.

Override any of these per repository with [`/orca:config`](#orcaconfig-assignments--reset) — except `context`, `address`, and `research`, which, like the workflow's internal helper agents (reconciliation, escalation), are not configurable: their cost/judgment profiles are part of the design.

## Configuration

**`.orca/config`** (repo root, written by `/orca:config`) — the reviewer choice and per-stage model/effort overrides, applied at the next run launch, plus the `/orca:review` keys, read fresh on each invocation. Flat dotted `key=value`, a closed lowercase-token vocabulary (a legacy `.orca/config.json` is no longer read — the pre-flight emits a `CONFIG: OBSOLETE:` signpost while one lingers, and `/orca:config` offers to delete it):

```
reviewer=claude
editor=nvim
terminal=tmux
agents.plan.effort=high
agents.implement.model=opus
```

A present `reviewer` key **pins** the choice; an absent key means each launch **detects** (codex on PATH at the minimum version → codex, else claude). `editor` (`nvim`|`vscode`|`none`) and `terminal` (`tmux`|`none`) carry the identical contract for `/orca:review` — absent detects (orca.nvim probe first, then orca.vscode's; `$TMUX`), a pin turns a missing dependency into a loud failure, `none` opts out to a printed command. They are machine preferences in a repo file — a deliberate trade: `.orca/` sits outside every worktree (effectively personal), detection means most users never set them, and one config surface beats a user-level layer for two keys. The `agents` overrides sit on top of the agent defaults. One block serves both verbs — the feature stages and the debug stages (`reproduce`, `hypothesize`, `verify`, `diagnose`) live side by side, and each run applies its own verb's keys while validating and ignoring the other's.

**`MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT`** — codex-only: client-side session env governing MCP tool-call timeouts; a plugin cannot ship it, so `/orca:doctor` writes it into the `env` block of `.claude/settings.local.json` (or `~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{ "env": { "MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT": "1200000" } }
```

~20 minutes is deliberate: the workflow retries reviews at two levels, so this value multiplies into the per-item worst case (~80 minutes at this setting; an hour would balloon it to several). Settings env loads at **session start** — restart the session after writing it.

**Bundled `.mcp.json`** — registers the codex MCP server as the global PATH binary, nothing else. Note what that means: the server runs **whatever `codex` is first on `$PATH`** in the session's environment — a shadowed or tampered binary there runs with the review's permissions, so treat PATH hygiene as part of the review trust story:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "orca-codex": { "command": "codex", "args": ["mcp-server"] } } }
```

The server is deliberately named `orca-codex`, not `codex`, so it can never collide with a user's own `codex` registration. A harsher failure mode has nothing to do with names: as of Claude Code 2.1.202, a project that carries any MCP config of its own — a `.mcp.json` at the repo root, or local-scope servers from `claude mcp add` — loads **none** of a plugin's bundled MCP servers (upstream bug; verified with installed plugins and `--plugin-dir` alike). The live MCP gate and `/orca:doctor` both diagnose it; the fix is removing the project-level registration (a leftover `codex` entry is redundant — the plugin bundles the server) or pinning `reviewer=claude` until the project's own MCP servers can coexist with plugins.

## Permissions and autonomy

A run only stays autonomous if the harness never raises a permission prompt: every workflow-spawned subagent inherits the session's permission mode, a single foreground prompt breaks autonomy mid-run, and an auto-denied call makes an agent fail confusingly instead.

**This requires `bypassPermissions` mode — an allow-list is not sufficient.** The subagents decide commands at runtime (dependency installs, build/test variants, assorted git invocations), so the command set is open-ended; and Bash permission rules match as prefix globs against the literal command string, so listed commands still slip through when they contain `$(…)`, lead with flags, or are compound. A leaked prompt is a question of *when*, not *whether*.

Enable it one of three ways: Shift+Tab in-session until the footer shows "bypass permissions" (easiest, right before the run); `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` at launch; or `"permissions": { "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions" }` in `.claude/settings.local.json` for always-unattended repos (offered by `/orca:doctor`, never defaulted).

The tradeoff is real and `/orca:feature` states it before starting: bypass mode disables the approval gate for the **whole session**, not just the run — a dedicated session for the run is the clean choice. If you won't enable it now, the run does not start (it would only pause partway), but the invocation ends cleanly with the brief saved and queued — enable bypass and re-invoke `/orca:feature` when ready.

## Interruption, resume, and cleanup

Recovery is a three-surface split, one per honest end state, and **recovery never creates a run — only new intent does**: an *interrupted* run (no `report.md` yet) resumes from its journal via its verb's triage; a *finished run with unmet items* is finished inside the same run by `/orca:retry`; a *finished run's optional follow-ups* become a new brief via `/orca:followup`. `/orca:status` is where "where was I?" gets answered before choosing: a strictly read-only dashboard that joins the `.orca/` state with git ground truth (unmerged deliverables, kept item branches, leftover `orca-*` worktrees, orphans) and names the owning skill per state — it prescribes cleanup commands where deletion is provably safe, but never runs them.

Every agent call in the work loop is journaled, and the workflow `runId` is persisted the moment the workflow launches — precisely because the interruption that needs it, session death, also erases the conversation. Feature runs persist it to the end of `spec.md` (as `**Workflow run:** <runId>`, alongside the launch-time reviewer as `**Workflow reviewer:**` and the launch-time `agents` block when one was passed); debug runs persist `**Workflow run:**` plus the full launch args as `**Workflow args:**` to the open case's `case.md`. A resume replays those recorded values, never the current `.orca/config`.

- **Interrupted run** (session death, kill, harness restart): invoke the same verb — `/orca:feature` triage discovers the interrupted run on disk via `spec.md`; `/orca:debug` triage finds it through its open case — and it offers the resume, re-invoking the workflow with the same script and args plus `resumeFromRunId`. Completed agent calls replay instantly from the journal; only in-flight and remaining work runs live. Never re-run stages conversationally.
- **Blocked items** keep their branch deliberately, with whatever was in the worktree salvaged as a `wip:` commit and the worktree removed — the report lists them for `/orca:retry`, which resolves the recorded decisions with you and relaunches only the unmet items in the same run, resuming those branches.
- **Open cases persist by design**: a debug run that ends `no-repro`, `undiagnosed`, or `not-fixed` leaves its case in `.orca/bug-cases/` with the ledger appended, and the next `/orca:debug` starts from it.
- **Abandoned run**: `git worktree list`, remove leftover `orca-*` worktrees and their `feature/<slug>*` (or `bug/<slug>*` / `fix/<slug>*`) branches. A leftover `orca-*` *directory* nowadays means an interrupted run or a pre-salvage blocked item — blocked items survive as branches only; everything else to clean up is branches. Prefer resuming.
- **Pre-plugin runs cannot resume** under the plugin (agent types, worktree names, and journal keys all changed) — clean up their leftovers and start fresh from a new brief.
- **Plugin upgrades mid-run**: an in-flight run should be finished (or retried) on the plugin version that started it — resuming across an upgrade is best-effort: changed prompts cache-miss and re-run live, and the CLI verbs' re-entrancy makes that degrade gracefully, not dangerously.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---|---|
| `BARE_REPO: FAIL: conventional checkout` | The repo isn't in the bare-with-worktrees layout. Run `/orca:init` — it converts interactively, preserving untracked files. |
| `CODEX: FAIL: codex not on PATH` / version too old | Install or upgrade the Codex CLI from the official non-npm distribution (`brew install codex` or the release binaries) — `/orca:doctor` walks it through. **Never `npm i -g @openai/codex`.** |
| `CODEX: FAIL: not authenticated` | Run `codex login` (interactive; your action, not the agent's). Verify with `codex login status`. `/orca:doctor` guides and re-checks. |
| `CODEX: FAIL: MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT not set` | Run `/orca:doctor` to write it into a settings env block, then start a fresh session. |
| Run used the Claude reviewer unexpectedly | The reviewer key is absent and codex wasn't detected — missing or below the minimum version. Fix codex via `/orca:doctor`, or pin `reviewer=codex` via `/orca:config` so a broken codex fails the pre-flight loudly instead. |
| `REVIEWER: FAIL: invalid reviewer` | The `reviewer` key in `.orca/config` is not `codex`/`claude` (or appears twice). Fix it with `/orca:config` — the pre-flight never guesses. |
| `PLUGIN_ROOT: FAIL: NO_PLUGIN_ROOT` (or the workflow refuses launch with `NO_PLUGIN_ROOT`) | The plugin-shipped CLI (`scripts/orca.sh`) isn't where the install put the rest of the plugin — the work loop's worktree/commit/merge rituals run through it, so nothing can commit. Reinstall the plugin; there is no inline fallback by design. |
| `/orca:feature` says the codex MCP tool doesn't resolve | Two causes. If the project has any MCP config of its own (a `.mcp.json` at the repo root, or local-scope servers — `claude mcp list` shows both), a Claude Code bug (as of 2.1.202) loads none of the plugin's bundled MCP servers: remove the redundant registration, or pin `reviewer=claude` if the project's own servers must stay. Otherwise check the plugin is installed and enabled — MCP servers load at session start, so the session may simply predate the install or enablement. Either way, start a fresh session in the project. |
| `/orca:feature` says the harness has no Workflow tool | The work loop needs a Claude Code harness with workflows; there is no conversational fallback. |
| Run pauses on a permission prompt | The session wasn't in `bypassPermissions` mode. Enable it (Shift+Tab) and re-invoke the verb — triage offers the resume from the journal — rather than restarting the run. |
| Debug run stopped at the repro gate (`no-repro`) | The bug could not be reproduced deterministically — the gate is hard by design, and there is no evidence-only fallback. The case is still open with the attempt recorded in its ledger; improve the case (repro steps, environment, evidence) and re-invoke `/orca:debug` — triage finds it. |
| Debug run ended `not-fixed` (or `undiagnosed` with a `fixBranch` in the result) | A committed fix (and its one internal retry) left `repro.sh` red — or exited 125, leaving the fix unverified (the returned `notes` say which). The case is open, the failed diffs sit in the history of `fix/<slug>` as ledger evidence, and re-invoking `/orca:debug` starts a smarter run: refuted hypotheses excluded, inconclusive ones first. |
| `git fetch` does nothing in a bare clone made by hand | Bare clones get no fetch refspec. `/orca:init`'s clone path sets `remote.origin.fetch` — do the same, or re-clone through it. |

## Migrating from the pre-plugin skills

Plugin versions before 0.2.0 shipped the interview and the run as two skills, `/orca:brief` and `/orca:run`. Both are folded into `/orca:feature` — triage decides between resume, run, and interview — and the old names are gone, with no aliases. The briefs directory is renamed too: move queued briefs with `mv .orca/briefs .orca/feat-briefs` at the repo root, after which they are discovered exactly as before. A run interrupted under `/orca:run` resumes under `/orca:feature` — the workflow journal keys on agent prompts, not on the script's (now-moved) path, and triage detects old run directories regardless of the new `feat-` naming (detection keys on `spec.md`, not the directory name).

This repository previously shipped the same workflow as symlink-installed skills named `briefify`/`initify`/`orchestrify` (plus a Codex CLI variant, now scrapped). If you used those:

- Remove the old symlinks from `~/.claude/skills` and `~/.claude/agents`.
- Queued briefs migrate with `mv .orchestrify .orca && mv .orca/briefs .orca/feat-briefs` at the repo root.
- In-flight pre-migration runs cannot resume under the plugin — clean up any leftover `orchestrify-*` worktrees and start fresh from a new brief.

## Repository contents

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | The plugin manifest (`orca`). |
| `.mcp.json` | Bundled codex MCP server registration — the global PATH `codex` binary, never npm. |
| `skills/feature/`, `skills/debug/`, `skills/review/`, `skills/retry/`, `skills/followup/`, `skills/status/`, `skills/init/`, `skills/doctor/`, `skills/config/` | The nine skills. |
| `skills/feature/interview.md`, `skills/debug/interview.md` | The interview instructions, loaded only when a verb's triage lands on a new interview. |
| `scripts/orca.sh preflight` | Read-only environment validation — the gate lines above. |
| `scripts/orca.sh config` | Sole reader/writer of `.orca/config` — parse, validation, merge semantics, atomic canonical writes (over `lib.sh`'s shared machinery); the grep-readers in the preflight verb and `review.sh` lean on its sole-writer guarantee. |
| `scripts/orca.sh triage` | Read-only discovery spine — interrupted/unlaunched runs with byte-exact resume handles, queued briefs, open cases (`discover`), and the git-footprint join for `/orca:status` (`status`). |
| `scripts/init-convert.sh` | The mechanical core of `/orca:init`'s conventional-to-bare conversion — gates, NUL-safe untracked moves, crash journal with signal traps, `recover`, and the manifest-checked `cleanup`. |
| `scripts/review.sh` | The deterministic spine of `/orca:review` — deliverable discovery, editor/terminal resolution, probes, and the launch; the skill converses, the script executes. |
| `scripts/orca.sh secrets` | Links `.orca/secrets/` (the mirror-tree secrets convention) into a worktree as relative symlinks — run by the loops and skills after every `worktree add`, and runnable by hand on your own worktree. |
| `scripts/work-loop.workflow.js` | The deterministic feature work loop, run through the Workflow tool — also nested by debug runs for the fix tail. |
| `scripts/debug-loop.workflow.js` | The deterministic debug loop: repro gate, hypothesis fan-out, verification, diagnosis, nested fix, repro check. |
| `agents/` | The seventeen stage agents, loaded as `orca:<stage>` (the reviewers are `review-codex` and `review-claude`; the debug stages are `reproduce`, `hypothesize`, `verify`, `diagnose`; `context` maintains the project context; `audit` reconciles a finished run for `/orca:retry` and `/orca:followup`). |
| `.github/workflows/version-bump.yml`, `.github/scripts/version-bump.sh` | Version-bump guard, run by GitHub Actions on every push to main: if shipped files (`skills/`, `agents/`, `scripts/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `.mcp.json`) changed since the commit that introduced the current manifest version, the action commits a bump to main — sized by Conventional Commits across the uncovered range (`!`/`BREAKING CHANGE` → major, `feat` → minor, else patch). The plugin updater keys its install cache on that version, so an unbumped push makes updates silently serve stale code. The check is stateless, so a missed run self-heals on the next push; a manual bump of any size covers the changes that land with it. Pull after pushing shipped changes to pick up the bot's bump commit. |
