name: orchestrify
description: Drive a substantial feature from idea to a verified integration branch using isolated Codex subagents, independent Claude Code reviews, and one git worktree per work item. Use when Codex should interview the user, write a spec and dependency-ordered work breakdown, plan and implement unblocked items in parallel, review each item with Claude and run a Codex fixer loop, commit each item, merge them into an integration worktree, and verify the assembled feature. Requires Codex multi-agent tools, an authenticated Claude CLI, and a bare-repository-with-worktrees layout. Do not use for small changes or when the user only wants a spec, plan, review, or commit.

# Orchestrify

Coordinate a feature through isolated subagents and git worktrees. Keep the main conversation focused on intent, state, and artifact summaries. Delegate deep exploration, implementation, review, conflict resolution, and integration verification.

The run produces an `orchestrify/<slug>` branch for the user to land. Never modify the user's worktree.

## Resolve bundled resources

Resolve this skill's installed directory before starting. Use:

- `scripts/preflight.sh` for the mechanical environment checks.
- `scripts/claude-review.sh` for independent review execution.
- `references/plan-agent.md`, `implement-agent.md`, `claude-review.md`, `fix-agent.md`, `commit-agent.md`, `merge-agent.md`, and `integrate-agent.md` as stage prompts.

Read a stage reference before spawning that stage. Include its complete instructions in the subagent prompt, followed by the per-item values. Do not assume subagents inherit this skill.

## 1. Interview and preflight

If no idea was provided, ask what to build.

Interview the user in one or two compact rounds:

- Define the outcome, required features, and explicit non-goals.
- Define inputs, outputs, side effects, and integration points.
- Capture compatibility, performance, scope, and delivery constraints.
- Choose the doubt rule: prefer smaller scope or prefer completeness. Default to smaller scope.
- Offer one optional checkpoint after the spec and breakdown but before code. Default to no checkpoint.
- Confirm the trunk branch reported by preflight.

Run the preflight script from the project root during the interview:

```bash
bash <skill-dir>/scripts/preflight.sh
```

It checks:

- `BARE_REPO`: the repository uses a shared bare object store with peer worktrees.
- `TRUNK_CANDIDATE`: the bare repository's default branch; confirm it with the user.
- `GIT`: required git features are available.
- `CLAUDE`: the Claude CLI is installed and authenticated.
- `TIMEOUT`: GNU `timeout` or `gtimeout` is available for bounded reviews.
- `RESULT`: success only when all gates pass.

On failure, stop and report the remediation. Do not convert the repository autonomously.

Confirm that this Codex session exposes the multi-agent spawn, wait, message, and close tools. If they are not currently loaded, discover them through the tool-discovery mechanism. If unavailable, stop.

The run must not depend on mid-run approval prompts. Before closing the interview, tell the user it requires a dedicated Codex session with filesystem and command permissions broad enough for worktree creation, dependency installation, builds, tests, and local git commits. If the active policy would prompt for routine operations, stop so the user can reconfigure the session. Never weaken platform security controls yourself.

Close by restating the outcome, features, non-goals, doubt rule, trunk, and checkpoint choice. The user's confirmation authorizes the run. After that, only pause for the opted-in checkpoint or a platform-enforced permission request.

## 2. Write the run artifacts

Resolve `<repo-root>` as the parent of:

```bash
git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir
```

Create:

```text
<repo-root>/
├── .bare/
├── <user worktrees...>
├── orchestrify-<slug>/                 # integration worktree
├── orchestrify-<slug>-<ID>/            # item worktrees
└── .orchestrify/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<slug>/
    ├── spec.md
    ├── state.md
    ├── plans/
    └── reviews/
```

Keep all worktrees at `<repo-root>`, never inside `.orchestrify/`. Make `<slug>` a short kebab-case phrase.

Do only light reconnaissance in the orchestrator context. Write `spec.md`:

```markdown
# Spec: <summary>

**Created:** <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM>
**Status:** draft

## Outcome
<What will exist when complete.>

## Features
- <Capability>

## Non-goals
- <Excluded scope>

## Inputs & Outputs
- **In:** <Data, events, or actions>
- **Out:** <Results, side effects, or artifacts>

## Interfaces Between Work Items
- **<Boundary>:** <Exact shared contract>

## Work Breakdown
| ID | Work item | Depends on | Files it owns |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| W1 | <Coherent unit> | — | <Paths or globs> |

## Assumptions
- <Assumption>

## Doubt Rule
<prefer-smaller-scope or prefer-complete>

## Risks & Open Questions
- <Risk or uncertainty>
```

Use 2-8 independently implementable, verifiable, and committable items. Define shared interfaces in the spec before parallel implementation. If two items cannot share an exact boundary, combine them.

Initialize `state.md` with one row per item and these states:

`pending → planning → planned → implementing → reviewing → committed → merged`

Use `blocked` with a reason for failures. Only `merged` unblocks dependents.

## 3. Checkpoint and integration worktree

Report the outcome, work items, dependency order, expected parallelism, and assumptions.

- If the user declined the checkpoint, proceed immediately.
- If the user opted in, ask once for approval and revise the artifacts as requested.

Set the spec status to `approved`, then create the integration worktree:

```bash
git worktree add <repo-root>/orchestrify-<slug> \
  -b orchestrify/<slug> <trunk>
```

## 4. Run the dependency loop

Repeat until every item is `merged` or `blocked`:

1. Select all `pending` items whose dependencies are `merged`.
2. Spawn their plan agents in parallel.
3. Reconcile all plans in the batch against each other and the spec interfaces.
4. Amend missed dependencies or contracts before implementation and regenerate affected plans.
5. Create one worktree per planned item from the current integration tip:

   ```bash
   git worktree add <repo-root>/orchestrify-<slug>-<ID> \
     -b orchestrify/<slug>-<ID> orchestrify/<slug>
   ```

6. Run implement, review/fix, and commit stages in parallel across independent items.
7. Serialize merges into the integration branch in dependency order, then completion order.
8. Update `state.md` after every transition and close completed subagents promptly.

Use `orchestrify/<slug>-<ID>`, not `orchestrify/<slug>/<ID>`; git cannot store the integration branch as both a ref file and a parent directory.

### Spawn discipline

Use fresh subagents for independent Codex stages. Claude review runs as a separate external process, so implementation and review contexts and model families remain separate.

- Use an explorer or default agent for planning.
- Use a worker agent for implementation, fixes, commits, merges, and integration.
- Assign exact worktree and file ownership in every worker prompt.
- State that other agents are working concurrently and that the agent must not revert their changes.
- Start independent agents before waiting. Wait only when their results are required for the next transition.
- Treat artifact files as authoritative. Agent summaries are status signals, not the handoff itself.

### Plan

Read `references/plan-agent.md`, then spawn one planner per ready item with:

- run directory
- item ID and title
- owned files
- repository root

The planner writes `<run-dir>/plans/<ID>.md`. Reconcile the whole ready batch before creating item worktrees.

### Implement

Read `references/implement-agent.md`, then spawn one worker per item with:

- item worktree
- run directory
- item ID and title
- owned files

The worker implements and verifies without committing.

### Review and fix

Read `references/claude-review.md` and assemble its prompt with the item values. Write the prompt to `<run-dir>/reviews/<ID>-prompt.md`, then run:

```bash
<skill-dir>/scripts/claude-review.sh \
  <worktree> \
  <run-dir>/reviews/<ID>-claude.md \
  <run-dir>/reviews/<ID>-prompt.md
```

The wrapper runs Claude Code read-only, retries once, and requires a non-empty artifact. On `CLAUDE_REVIEW: FAILED`, mark the item blocked; never interpret missing output as approval.

Read the Claude review artifact. If there are code-rooted Critical or High findings, read `references/fix-agent.md` and spawn a Codex fixer in the same worktree. Re-run Claude review over the new state. Allow at most two fix rounds.

Escalate immediately when a finding is rooted in the spec, plan, shared interface, or another item. Medium and Low findings may proceed only when explicitly recorded in the plan's Deviations section with a concrete reason.

Throttle concurrent Claude reviews to 2-3 to avoid auth and rate-limit contention.

### Commit

Read `references/commit-agent.md` and spawn a commit worker. Validate its returned commit message. If it mentions Codex, AI, agents, orchestration, or the user, soft-reset the commit and retry with the violation quoted.

Record the commit hash and mark the item `committed`.

### Merge

Read `references/merge-agent.md` and spawn one merge worker at a time in the integration worktree.

After a successful merge:

```bash
git worktree remove <repo-root>/orchestrify-<slug>-<ID>
git branch -d orchestrify/<slug>-<ID>
```

Mark the item `merged`. Preserve a failed item's worktree and branch.

## 5. Handle structural problems

Never silently change the agreed product intent.

Amend and continue when the change preserves the confirmed outcome, features, and non-goals. Update the spec and affected plans, and add a `## Decisions` entry explaining the change and the doubt rule applied.

Block and route around when every solution would change what the user authorized. Mark the item `blocked`, record the decision options, keep its worktree, and continue unaffected items. Ask for the decision only in the final report.

If the doubt rule is smaller scope and an optional feature can be cleanly removed without violating the confirmed requirements, record that cut as an amendment.

## 6. Verify integration

After the loop drains, read `references/integrate-agent.md` and spawn an integration worker in the integration worktree. It must run the full build and tests and exercise every feature against the spec.

If it makes small fixes, run Claude review and the Codex fix loop over the integration diff, then use the commit stage. Treat larger mismatches as structural problems.

## 7. Report

Report:

- shipped items and commit hashes
- deviations and decisions
- blocked items and the choices required
- feature-by-feature integration results
- the deliverable branch: `orchestrify/<slug>`
- the user's landing command: `git merge --no-ff orchestrify/<slug>`

## Invariants

- Never write to the user's worktree.
- Never let two agents write the same worktree concurrently.
- Never attribute commits to Codex, AI, agents, the orchestration process, or the user.
- Never relay large diffs or test logs through the orchestrator context; use artifacts and concise summaries.
- Never mark an item complete before its merge succeeds.
- Never treat an absent review artifact as approval.
- Keep one item worktree through implementation, review, fix, and commit; remove it only after merge.
- Keep the user informed at phase transitions with concise one-way updates.
